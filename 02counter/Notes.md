# React Counter Component with `useState`

## Key Features:
1. **State Management with `useState`:**
   - React's `useState` hook is used to create a state variable `counter` and a function `setCounter` to update it.
   - Initial value of `counter` is set to `0`.

2. **Functions for Increment and Decrement:**
   - `addValue`: Increases the counter by 1 when called.
   - `decreaseValue`: Decreases the counter by 1 when called.

3. **Rendering the Counter Value:**
   - The current value of `counter` is displayed in the `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` elements. This allows us to see the updated counter value in different parts of the UI.

4. **Buttons for Increment/Decrement:**
   - Two buttons are provided to increase (`Increment ++`) and decrease (`Decrement --`) the counter value.
   - Each button calls the corresponding function (`addValue` or `decreaseValue`) when clicked.
